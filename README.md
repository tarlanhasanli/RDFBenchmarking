#### Berlin SPARQL Benchmark (BSBM) Specification - V2.0

The purpose of project to make comparision between CSV, Avro, ORC, Parquet data types and Hive/Postgres Databases to find better way to store our data. The comparision is made with measuring RAM, CPU and Time that has been cosumed while running Benchmark Queries. 

The more information about bencmark can be found from: http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/berlinsparqlbenchmark/

The overall process is as follows:
1. Data Generation
2. Schema Creation and Data conversion
3. Query generation
4. Performance measurement


##### 1. Data generation
There is a Java (at least JVM 1.5 needed) implementation of a data generator and a test driver for the BSBM benchmark. The source code of the data generator and the test driver can be downloaded from Sourceforge BSBM tools. http://sourceforge.net/projects/bsbmtools/

After downloading BSBM tool, the data is generated by using following command: java -cp lib/* benchmark.generator.Generator -fc -pc <number of products> -s <output format>. I chose 1000 products, N-Triples file format.
